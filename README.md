# members-only

This is a project on user authentication and authorization for [The Odin Project: Authentication](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/authentication).

The members-only homepage displays posts made by registered users. Names of the authors are only displayed to other logged-in users.

I have implemented all the functionality needed to register, log in, log out, write posts, and view them.

This exercise really helped me cement the knowledge contained in the RailsTutorial chapters I did previously. I'm much more comfortable with creating my own models, controllers, and the views which interact with them.

This was a project in roll-your-own authentication, but in the future I will definitely be using a battle-tested authentication gem like Devise.
